### Fungi game
Fungi, a strategic card game for two players, uses two decks: a Day Deck that includes ten different types of mushrooms as well as baskets, cider, butter, pans, and moons; and a smaller Night Deck of mushrooms to be foraged by moonlight. 


Each mushroom card has two values: one for selling and one for cooking. Selling two or more mushrooms grants foraging sticks that expand your options. Cooking sets of three or more like mushrooms – sizzling in butter or cider if the set is large enough – earns points toward winning the game.
